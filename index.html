       Don't forget to log off when you leave a website, especially if you are using a shared computer. If you don, someone can easily pretend to be you.
      Don't tell anyone passwords and don't write them down in an obvious place. Make them more complex by using a combination of letters, numbers and punctuation marks.
      Tell an adult if you come across anything online that makes you upset, anxious or concerned. There are ways to report inappropriate or abusive content and in most cases web managers respond rapidly.
